# ESP-Kickstart Template

The "ESP-Kickstart" template is a foundational framework designed to simplify the development of real-world IoT projects using ESP-based devices. It provides a structured starting point with essential features to accelerate development and focus on project-specific goals.

## Key Features

The ESP-Kickstart template includes the following functionalities:

- **Wi-Fi Connectivity**: Supports both Station and Access Point (AP) modes with DHCP or static IP for faster and reliable connections.
- **OTA Updates**: Built-in Over-The-Air (OTA) update daemon for seamless firmware upgrades.
- **MQTT Integration**:
  - Automatic registration, message subscription, and publishing using a well-structured topic hierarchy.
  - Validates and parses MQTT messages to interact with internal variables and functions.
- **Command Interfaces**:
  - Telnet session support for issuing commands using the same engine as the MQTT message parser.
  - Serial connection support for issuing commands, also leveraging the MQTT message parser engine.
- **Home Assistant Integration**: Supports MQTT Discovery for seamless integration with Home Assistant.
- **Time Synchronization**: Internal date and time synchronization via NTP.
- **Persistent Configuration**: Stores configuration data on local flash and/or remotely using MQTT persistant topic.
- **Web Interface**: Provides a web page for initial configuration and setup.
- **Clean Code Structure**:
  - Simplified `setup()` and `loop()` functions to focus on the core project logic.
  - Global variables and functions are well-organized for easy access and integration into project's code.


## Benefits for Developers
